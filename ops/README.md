## The application

Let's say you have a multi-tier blogging application.

* A front-end built in static HTML
* A backend built in PHP
* A MySQL storage

There is no fancy requirements, blogging is just an example of a very basic application.

## Objectives

You have to make a proposal of an architecture by editing the file [proposal](proposal.md) in this very repository.

The application should be available on the Internet, the objective here is to reduce [SPOFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure) and secure the application. The number of users is currently small but the application should be able to scale if need be. You are the person who should know if the hardware should evolve, so you need tools for this.

Name softwares, tools and how you plan to integrate them in your architecture. We expect you to explain your choices, the pros, the cons, and what are the limitations of the technology you chose.

If changes has to be made directly in the code of the application, note your advises for the fictional dev team.

Do not hesitate to illustrate your proposal with graphs.
